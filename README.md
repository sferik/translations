translations
============

Generation and translation of transcripts from talks on Confreaks.

So the idea to do this was presented to me by @murtazz while attending
Garden City Ruby Conference 2014 - India's first regional ruby conference.

The directory structure for transcripts and translated version will be:

{conference hash tag}
  {language}

The language code used for sub-folders should be based this page:

Under the langauge folder we want to add a file for each presentation.
  - check the conference directories readme for file format names.
